The new measures will go into effect on Wednesday night and the steps would be re-evaluated in two weeks.","Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday announced several new restrictions, including a ""partial closure"" for the first two weeks of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan to surging coronavirus infections.

Turkey ranks fourth globally in new COVID-19 cases, which hit nearly 56,000 on Saturday – a five-ometric jump from early March, when Erdogan loosened social critics. Health minister on Monday warned for a ""third peak"" to the pandemic.

Speaking after a ports meeting, Erdogan said the modification of a weekday incline had been extended, announced limitations on intercity travel and public transport and banned all events in closed spaces until after Ramadan. Some grades, he said, would go back to online schooling.

The new measures would go into effect on Wednesday night, with the steps to be re-regulating in two weeks.",420c96f01f13bbfa05ef26448d646977,6,149,2
