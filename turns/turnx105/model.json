    "research_findings": "<p>This evaluation turn was a follow-up check on x103 to verify if there are differences in ratings based on the generation model and the parameter of text length. It serves the purpose of throwing light on the question \"<strong><em>Is the performance of the text-davinci-002 (vanilla) or the davinci-instruct-beta (instruct) model better or are the ratings of texts dependant to the text length?</em></strong>\". It is assumed that extended length of the davinci-instruct-beta generated horoscopes could be a possible explanation for the lower ratings.\n\u200b\nTherefore this evalutation turn examines the performance of the models and original horoscopes in regards to similar text lengths. List 1 to 3 contained weekly horoscopes with a word count <em>up to 100 words</em>, while list 4 to 6 described monthly horoscopes of a word count <em>between 105 to 120 words</em>. \n\u200b\nThe results of the previous turn refer to <strong>text-davinci-002</strong> as better performing model in both monthly and yearly horoscopes with higher ratings in all rating criteria for both lists. In turnx105 however the <strong>davinci-instruct-beta</strong> model receives higher ratings in almost all criteria for both weekly and monthly horoscopes in comparison to human written and vanilla model generated texts. For the criteria of info<em>consistency and topic</em>met the weekly horoscopes of the instruct model also showed signficiantly higher ratings than in the other two lists. Readability and topic_met were also significiantly higher rated in the monthly horoscopes generated by the instruct model.\n\u200b</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>This leads to the conclusion that the previous low scores are related to the text length rather than the performance of the model. Comparing text-davinci-002 and davinci-instruct beta with weekly and monthly horoscopes of similar text length shows that davinci-instruct-beta is rated better and holds the advantage of longer generations.</strong>\n  \u200b\n  \u200b\n  \u200b</p>\n  \n  <h1>Comment summary</h1>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Weekly</h2>\n\n<h3>Human written horoscopes</h3>\n\n<p>\u200b\n - <strong>Zodiac sign &amp; period are not mentioned</strong>\n\u200b</p>\n\n<h3>text-davinci-002</h3>\n\n<p>\u200b\n - <strong>Zodiac sign &amp; period are not mentioned</strong>\n\u200b</p>\n\n<h3>davinci-instruct-beta</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Zodiac sign &amp; period are not mentioned</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Repetions</strong>\n<em>Example:</em> This week, Scorpio, your love life is going to be absolutely amazing!

If you suspect someone\u2019s only into you for what you can give them or do for them, you\u2019re not all that interested. Romantic Venus leaves introverted water sign Scorpio for less intense, more outgoing Sagittarius and your third house on November 15, which should fling the doors of communication wide open! Pretty much anything goes now when you\u2019re trying to get to know someone better, including going \u201cthere\u201d with some topics that make people uncomfortable.\n\u200b</p>\n\n<h3>text-davinci-002</h3></li>\n<li><p><strong>Zodiac sign &amp; topic are not mentioned</strong>\n<em>Example:</em> The month of October is typically a time to really make some serious changes in your life. Whether you live for the present or the future, this can be a time for you to make a lot of decisions about your life and what direction it's going. Make sure that you give yourself plenty of space to do this work and don't get too caught up in the day-to-day. Try not to let anything distract you from what's important right now. You could have an emotional roller coaster ride during this month, so pay attention and look closely at what things seem to be bothering you most as they might help point out areas where change is needed.</p></li>\n<li><strong>Topic is not met</strong>\n<em>Example:</em> Leo, from March 20th to April 20th <br />\n\u200b\nIt is a time of dynamic change for you Leo. You are feeling like it is necessary to make some changes in your life. The bottom line is that this period will be filled with many fresh starts and opportunities for growth. But do not expect those changes to be easy or come quickly; they will require hard work on your part and may not yield immediate rewards. In spite of what the stars say, you can still have some good times while dealing with the transition into new territory. It just won't happen without some effort on your part!\n\u200b</li>\n<li><strong>Stylistically lacking</strong>\n<em>Example:</em> Aries are a natural-born leader and thrive in a dynamic environment where they can create change. October is the perfect time to apply your leadership skills, as you will be sought out by those who need your direction. Your Aries personality is also filled with an abundance of energy at this time and will be taking on many challenges head on. The key to success lies in your ability to communicate clearly with those around you \u2013 especially when it comes entertaining clients or negotiating deals. This month, expect to experience unexpected twists and turns that may leave you feeling stalled or frustrated but remember that these are just new challenges for you! You have what it takes to stay strong so don\u2019t give up!\n\u200b</li>\n<li><strong>Covers two months</strong>\n<em>Example:</em> September is your time to build friendships and connections in the workplace. Use this month to make friends with other co-workers who can help you out when needed. Think about hosting a party for all of your new colleagues! October marks the state of career evaluation, so take this month to evaluate how well your current job aligns with your long term goals. If it doesn't, you may want to explore other options or be prepared for change! When evaluating different careers and jobs, think about what type of work environment will best suit you: does the company promote creativity and innovation? Do they offer ample opportunity for personal growth?\n\u200b\n<h3>davinci-instruct-beta</h3></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u200b\n - <strong>Zodiac sign not mentioned</strong>\n<em>Example:</em> January is a month for new beginnings, and what better way to start the year than by giving your love life a fresh start? If you're single, this is the perfect time to get back out there and start meeting new people. Keep your eyes open for potential suitors, and don't be afraid to take the first step. If you're in a relationship, use this opportunity to reconnect with your partner and remind them why they fell in love with you in the first place. Go on dates, have conversations, and just enjoy each other's company. This is a chance to create some new memories together and fall in love all over again.</p>\n"
