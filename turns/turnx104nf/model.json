    "research_findings": "<ol> <li><u>On the comparison between the models with varying training data (3.0 and 3.0b)</u> <br/><b>HYBRID</b>: Statistically significant differences could be found for the criteria <b>grammar</b> and <b>lexical_correctness</b>. More specifically, the 0.3.0b model produced more grammatically correct paraphrases while the 0.3.0 model generated texts which contained more appropriate lexical replacements. The difference in overall quality, while marginally better for the 0.3.0 model, was not found to be statistically significant. <i>(p_value=0.7018)</i>. <br/><b> RAW</b>: In most criteria, the 0.3.0 model produced better rated texts than the 0.3.0b model. Albeit not being statistically significant, the differences in the Likert scale criteria <b>content_similarity</b>, <b>linguistic_difference</b> and <b>overall_quality</b> were marginally better for the 0.3.0 model. Citations, however, were found to be better paraphrased in the 0.3.0b model. <i>(p_value=0.000)</i>. </li><br/> <li><u>On the comparison between the generation cycles (hybrid and raw)</u> <br/><b>3.0</b>: Similar to the comparison of the raw generation cycles above, the 0.3.0 model with a raw generation cycle produced better rated texts than the 0.3.0 model with a hybrid generation cycle. The differences are also most noticeable (and were found to be statistically significant) in the aforementioned Likert scale criteria. In terms of overall_quality, more outliers were found for the 0.3.0 model with a hybrid generation cycle. <br/><b>3.0b</b>: A trend could be observed here that the raw generation cycle with the same model produced better rated texts than with the hybrid generation cycle. The differences are most noticeable in the aforementioned Likert scale criteria. In terms of overall_quality, more outliers were found for the 0.3.0b model with a hybrid generation cycle. </li><br/></ol>"
